I’m Gabriel Lucero (@Nectama), frontend developer learning the basics and making some projects.
I work with HTML5|CSS3 & Javascript
I’m interested in learning React.Js in the future and to develop myself as a frontend dev (and maybe add some knowledge in backend)

Currently learning more Javascript and looking for my first job in the IT world
I’m looking to collaborate on challenging projects, although i might not yet be a very efficient dev, I love challenges that make me learn and grow.
